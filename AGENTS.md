# Agent Instructions

- Use `pnpm` for dependency management and scripts.
- Preferred checks before submitting changes:
  - `pnpm lint`
  - `pnpm build`
- Avoid adding generated `dist` assets to commits unless explicitly required.
- Keep documentation updates minimal unless the task calls for them.
